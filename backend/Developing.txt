Follow these steps when writing code:

1. Implement 
    - Write a small, specific functionallity required for the tas.
2. Test
    - Write a test for the component.
    - Run the specific test
3. Iterate
    - If the test fails, add print debugging and repeat step 1 and 2
4. Reflect
    - Can I refactor the code to reduce duplication? Make sure to look at other files as well
    - Will this change break other functionality?
    - Are there any glaring performance flaws? 
5. Repeat
    - Continue on to the next component required for the task. 
6. Mantra
    - Say "The steps are: "Implement, Test, Iterate, Reflect, Repeat, Mantra, I must follow them".
